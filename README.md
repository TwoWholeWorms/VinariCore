# VinariCore

VinariCore is an extension to the ZF2 Skeleton Application which pulls together a bunch of additional libraries and some
custom code which I use in a lot of the projects I work on. It made sense to abstract the same few files I use everywhere
into a library I can just include via composer. :)

## Installation and usage instructions

 php composer.phar require twowholeworms/vinari-core
